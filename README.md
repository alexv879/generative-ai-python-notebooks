# Generative AI – OpenAI API, DeepSeek & ChatGPT (Course Practice)

This repository contains code and exercises from the **"Generative AI: OpenAI API, DeepSeek, and ChatGPT in Python"** course by Lazy Programmer Inc. It was completed as part of my practical training in generative AI, including OpenAI's GPT models, prompt engineering, DeepSeek models, and API-based deployments in Python.

## 📚 Course Topics Covered

- ChatGPT, GPT-4, and OpenAI API usage via Python
- Prompt engineering (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT)
- Fine-tuning vs. embeddings
- Conversational agents and chatbots
- Text generation and summarization
- Using **DeepSeek** models (instruction-tuned)
- Real-world applications via API calls

## ⚙️ My Experience

While the code remains largely unmodified, I worked through all hands-on examples using:
- Jupyter/Colab for experimentation
- OpenAI & DeepSeek APIs for model interaction
- Prompt testing and agent logic exploration

This helped strengthen my understanding of how to build production-ready GenAI systems and interfaces.
